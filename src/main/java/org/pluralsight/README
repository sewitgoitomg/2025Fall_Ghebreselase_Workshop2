         /Here is an outline of what should go in your book class
         //There should NOT be any code that deals with menus
         //There should NOT be any code that takes in user input
         //All this class cares about is book data
         //and what to do when the book is checked in or out, that's it


Main
           //You'll need a menu. A while(true) loop will be helpful

            //Based on what they type, make a switch case to handle it
            //Be sure they can exit the program!

            //Use a for loop and sout to print all the book titles
            //remember to use your Book class getters
            //Use if statements to filter out books that are checkedin/out
            //as need be

            //You will call the checkIn() and checkOut() methods
            //If the user wants to check in or out
            //Remember if they check out you must ask for their name!
            //example: book.checkOut(name) or book.checkIn()
